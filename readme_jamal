write down a reflection paragraph on the observational tool exercises (tip: you can link to images/ drawings);

MY OBSERVATIONAL TOOL I TOOK QUITE LITERALLY. IT IS A TOOL I USE DAILY, MY POINT AND SHOOT CAMERA. WTIH JOSEPH I LEARNED DIFFERENT WAYS OF MAKING IMAGES. WE STARTED WITH A VIDEO ABOUT FRAMING THINGS DIFFERENTLY BY ZOOMING IN AND OUT ON THE WORLD. I CAN TAKE THAT LITERALLY BY ZOOMING IN OR OUT ON MY SUBJECTS, BUT ALSO BY LOOKING DEEPER INTO THINGS I FIND INTERESTING OR TAKING A STEP BACK. LOOKING AT THE WORLD THROUGH A CAMERA LENS HELPS ME SEE THINGS PRETTIER THAN BEFORE AND ALSO REFRAMING MY VIEW ON THINGS. I OBSERVE DAILY LIFE DIFFERENTLY.

                      CONNECTTIONS
WHAT CAN I DO WITH THIS?
HOW FAR DOES IT GO?
WHAT TYPE OF CONNECTION?
WHAT CAN IT SUPPORT (IS IT STRONG)?
CAN YOU TAKE IT APART AND PUT IT TOGETHER?
QUALITY OF CONNECTION

WHAT ARE THE INPUTS AND OUTPUTS, IT IS A TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM FROM 1 THING TO ANOTHER
                      15 MIN EXPLORATION
 1) SEWING MACHINE
 THREAD, BUTTONS, PEDAL, POWER, LIGHT, LIGHTBULB, STICKER, TABLE, SCREWS, TENSION ROUNDTHING, WIRES, FOOT, NEEDLE, SCREEN
 
 IT IS MECHANICAL AND ELECTRIC
 
 CAN SUPPORT CERTAIN THREADS AND FABRIC NOT THICKER THAN THE GAP OF THE "FOOT"
 NEEDLE CANNOT PIERCE EVERYTHING (BUT CAN BE REMOVED AND SWITCHED FOR A SHARPER STRONGER NEEDLE??)
 CAN BE TAKEN APART VIA SCREWS AND HINGES
 PEDAL AS POWER SOURCE, NEEDLE MAKES SOUND WHEN IS PRESSED, CAN BE USED AS A HI HAT PEDAL FOR INTSTRUMENT
 CONNECTS TO FABRIC WHEN THREAD IS IN
 
 2) WINDOW
 GLASS, WOOD, METAL BRACKETS, THREAD, BLINDS, LATCHH TO WALL, LEVER TO KEEP FROM OPENING COMPLETELY, WIRE CONNECTED TO BLINDS TO OPEN AND CLOSE
 
 EASILY REMOVABLE WITH POWER TOOLS
 CONNECTS INSIDE TO OUTSIDE
 PURPOSE FOR INSULATION
 LIGHT AND COLOR
 VISUAL SYSTEM
 BLOCKS OXYGEN
 CAN BE HACKED TO MAKE A PROJECTOR
 
write a summary on the Hacking lecture by Florian Cramer;

TOUCHED ON A LOT OF INTERESTING SUBJECTS INCLUDING HACKER CULTURE WHICH I FOUND THE MOST DYNAMIC AND APPLICABLE SUBJECT FOR MY STUDY (ADV)
HACKERS COMMUNICATED THROUGH YIPL ZINES AS THE HACKER BIBLE
THEY ASK WHAT IS IMPOSSIBLE AND TRY TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE
THEY TOOK GEEK AND NERD AND CREATED THE POSITIVE FORM OF IT WITH THE TERM "HACKER"
GOOD V BAD HACKER (WHITE HAT V BLACK HAT)

THE HACKING I AM MOST INTERESTED IN FROM HIS LECTURE IS THAT THEY WANT TO SHARE INFORMATION FOR FREE (THE PIRATE BAY AND SIMILAR SITES DO THIS SUCCESSFULLY FOR THE MOST PART)
YES MEN IS A SOCIAL HACK TO MAKE CHANGE FOR GOOD BY FINDING LOOPHOLES AND STUPIDITY IN THE NEWS' CRAVING TO HAVE BREAKING REPORTS WITHOUT MUCH BACKGROUND INFORMATION
HACKING ALSO DEALS WITH ANONYMITY AS A POWER.

write a summary on the exercise you developed at Varia;

VARIA HAD US USE THE POWER OF REMOVING ITEMS TO CREATE BETTER SYSTEMS, SIMPLICITY CANNOT BE HACKED SO EASILY SO THERE ARE NOT TOO MANY MOVING PARTS TO GO WRONG. THE SIMPLEST SOUPS WERE THE MOST ACCESABLE TO PEOPLE BECAUSE THEY WERE EASY TO UNDERSTAND.

revise all the topics above and reflect on the possible meaning of 'Hacking' (Respond to the questions: What is the context in which you operated? What physical systems did you investigate? What did you find? What is your hacking method? If your method is a tool set, how would you explain to someone else how to use it? In what way are these tools limited/biased?);
